MINI-MAX SUM

Time complexity: O(n^2), since the code ocntains a nested for loop.
Space complexity: O(n), sicne the algorithm works with only one array of n size


WEIGHTED UNIFORM STRING

Time complexity: O(n), since there is a for loop based on the length n of the given Array List.
Space complexity: O(n), since there is input of an Array List and a string with size n.
